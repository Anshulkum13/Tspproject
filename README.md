# üó∫Ô∏è Travelling Salesman City-Tour Optimizer

Optimize your city tour using geodesic math and classic TSP heuristics. This Python project reads a list of landmarks from a CSV file, calculates distances using the Haversine formula, and generates the shortest possible route using Greedy and 2-opt algorithms. The final route is exported as a GeoJSON file for easy visualization in Google Maps.
